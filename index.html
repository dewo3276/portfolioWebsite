      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello, I'm Destin Woods and I create stuff for a living! Carpenter and metal worker at heart, I am jack of all trades kinda guy ready to tackle any task thrown my way. From graphic and industrial design to coding and circuitry, I've dabbled
        in it all. Still sharp and willing to learn, my skill set grows everyday. I've worked in the theater for 4 years as the Master Carpenter at CU Theater and Dance. When I'm not working, I like to tinker and create new inventions or digital art,
        sail, or hike. As a recent graduate of the class of 2021, I am eager to enter the work force with a B.S. in Creative Technology and Design from the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>

      <div class="threeXthree">
        <p class="description">This project was designed by myself and coworker Hannah Male for the play "She Kills Monsters". It was designed with the intention of being on a green screen and edited for film during the COVID-19 pandemic. The whole
          head was painted
          white to allow for the lighting crew to add different colors to it during filming to produce the five headed hydra so five different heads didn't need to be created. The mechanical requirements for the show was for it to have pitch in one
          direction and yaw at the base of the neck and connection point behind the green screen via a custom built mounting device. The skull also had to have a movable jaw for line delivery which was operated by a pulley system and lizard frills
          also operated by a pulley system. </p>

      <div class="twoXtwo">
        <p class="description">These hide away stairs provided an ease of access for actors in the production of Broadway Christmas Carol to dance on the tables for multiple musical numbers. These tables also functioned as many different set pieces
          as they were designed to be mobile with a functioning wheel lift system. Trim was added after the initial construction was done and tests were conducted to ensure safety as well as functionality by the actors. To better conceal the ladder,
          a hinged door held by magnets was added. After some failures with this system, these magnets were replaced as the tap dances that occurred on that table cause the doors to swing open at random intervals. There was also a problem with the
          trim interfering with the rotation of the wheels, so cuts were made to allow for full spin of the wheels.</p>

        <p class="description">
          This set was created for the musical hair. It was created by reusing some pieces from previous shows and adjusting some of these pieces. A rectangular frame was cut from a previous platform, some dimensions were changed throught plasma
          cutting and MIG welding new pieces and faced with 3/4" plywood cut with a jigsaw. Turf and specially built stair units were stagged to give the hill coming up to the bridge a safe way for actors to ascend as well as give the illusion of a
          hill. The handrail was created using a tube bender. The benches and other set pieces were modified to be able to easily be moved by actors during scenes. The benches were the plastic benches you would see at parks that are quite heavy and
          neede to be replaced with some 2x4's.

          Hecuba was created using many different rigging techniques along with some foam carving and painting. The beams across the proscenium were built with long sonotube with foam strips cut in long rectangular strips glued around the diameter.
          It was then covered in muslin fabric after the foam was carved and given some texture to appear like misshapen logs. These were then hung from the front linesets using genie lifts and rope wrapped around the pieces. The backdrops served as
          a way to create many different levels within the scenes when the dream sequences with Hecuba occur as her dead children haunt her dreams. These were backlit to create haunting silhouettes.

          it togehter to create circles. This set also taught me how to weld two dis-similar metals together as we had a lot of alumninum fence pieces to weld to steel.</p>

          Colorado Alpha
          chapter, this project meant a lot to me and my brothers.
          The letters themselves were cut from 16 gauge steel sheets using a plasma cutter. To achieve precise shapes, I cut out stencils I designed in Rhino on the laser cutter using plywood. Once the stencils were cut, they were placed on the sheet
          metal and clamped securely in place so I could use them as a guide for the plasma cutting tool. Anchors were added to the back of the letters, spray painted, placed into pre-drilled holes in the house, and secured with construction
          adhesive.</p>

          board and get the most points. The scoreboard had a few functions that kept track of score as well as let the user know what their current score was.</p>
